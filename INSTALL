INSTALLING

 The perl standard build process is followed:

  perl Makefile.PL
  [n|d]make
  [n|d]make test
  [n|d]make install

 Should build with no warnings using MS Visual C compiler (MSCV6 and upwards).

 To build with Mingw/gcc: a recent Mingw package should do the trick.
 Development and testing has been with gcc 3.4.5.  This is the Mingw
 distribution that ships with Strawberry Perl Portable.

 To build under Cygwin: This has not been tested, but should have the
 same constrains as building with Mingw/gcc above.

 x64 builds: This has not been tested, but there is no known reason why
 this should not work.

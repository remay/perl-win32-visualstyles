Win32::VisualStyles - Apply Win32 Visual (aka XP) Styles to windows

INSTALLING

 The perl standard build process is followed:

  perl Makefile.PL
  [n|d]make
  [n|d]make test
  [n|d]make install

 Should build with no warnings using MS Visual C compiler (MSCV6 and upwards).

 To build with Mingw/gcc: a recent Mingw package should do the trick.
 Development and testing has been with gcc 3.4.5.  This is the Mingw
 distribution that ships with Strawberry Perl Portable.

 To build under Cygwin: This has not been tested, but should have the
 same constrains as building with Mingw/gcc above.

 x64 builds: This has not been tested, but there is no known reason why
 this should not work.

SEEING IT IN ACTION

 If you have the Win32::GUI module available then there is a script,
 themes.pl, that you can run to see the effect of the various API calls.

 Otherwise try these one-liners:

  C:\>perl -MWin32 -e"Win32::MsgBox(q(Some Message))"
  C:\>perl -MWin32 -MWin32::VisualStyles -e"Win32::MsgBox(q(Some Message))"
